# Artrium
## Description
Artrium is your daily tab that can save bookmarks.
You can quickly search google, and easily add & remove your bookmarks.
Just enjoy without any logins, cookies.
You can use this site better with this [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en).
This extension lets you to redirect new tabs, which means it can make you able to quickly access to google, and your bookmarks in Artrium.

And this, is New version of Artrium. Once Artrium was seperated into two: Artrium and Artrium Beta, but I decided to abandon old Artrium and raise Artrium Beta (which is Artrium New currently). New version includes design improvements, improvement on code and etc. Unfortunatly, as the site domain and repo moves all the preferences and bookmarks' data will be lost.

## New Features - Version N2
- Design Improvements
- Cleaner Source Code
- Can Delete User Data
- Bookmark Limits
- Custom Background Color
- <s>Custom Background Image</s> (Available on Version N2.5)

## Availability
Mobile is not well supported in Artrium, yet. It will be indicated: 'Sorry, Artrium is not for Mobile'.

Since acrylic theme contains very much acrylic contents (it blurs the background of element), it may slow down your PC due to the process of blurring the background of element. If it slows down your PC, you may use the alternative: glass theme. Also, acrylic theme works poorly in Firefox browser. I recommend you to use Chrome or Chromium-based browser, such as Edge, Brave, and etc.

(Note: Artrium was tested on MS Edge (Chromium). There may be some differences by devices.)
