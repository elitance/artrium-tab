You can use this site better with this [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en).
This extension lets you to redirect new tabs, which means it can make you able to quickly access to google, and your bookmarks in Artrium.

And this, is Beta versions of Artrium. You can register beta program by just enabling beta features on Artrium's Preferences. Beta version includes design improvements, improvement on code and etc. Most of the features in beta version will be supported on [Artrium](https://github.com/ldhan0715/artrium) later on, but some of the features won't be supported. Just remind that beta versions didn't had a test before release, so that any errors can be occured. And one more thing, bookmarks will be synced with original Artrium and beta Artrium.

## Availability
Mobile is not well supported in Artrium. It will be indicated: 'Sorry, Artrium is not for Mobile'. In addition, I have no plans for mobile version of Artrium.

Since acrylic theme contains very much acrylic contents (it blurs the background of element), it may slow down your PC due to the process of blurring the background of element. If it slows down your PC, you may use the alternative: glass theme. Also, acrylic theme works poorly in Firefox browser. I recommend you to use Chrome or Chromium-based browser, such as Edge, Brave, and etc.

(Note: Artrium was tested on MS Edge (Chromium). There may be some differences by devices.)
